I have synesthesia. The first line of the Wikipedia article has this to say about it:


> Synesthesia is a perceptual phenomenon in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to automatic, involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway. People who report a lifelong history of such experiences are known as synesthetes.


Despite attempting to explain this to scores of people, I'm not confident anyone has actually ever understood what I was talking about save for other synesthetes and some people who dropped acid.


Synesthesia presents itself in many ways. One of the more prevalent forms of synesthesia is grapheme-color. Grapheme-color is the association of letters and/or numbers to specific (and I mean _specific_) colors. Let's do a thought experiment. Grab a pen or pencil and write the word “sofa” on a piece of paper. Now, when you read the “s”, think of the color green. For someone with _associative_ grapheme-color synesthesia, reading the letter automatically triggers the mind's eye perception of the color green. For someone with _projective_ grapheme-color synesthesia, reading the letter automatically triggers a _visual_ perception of the color green. Note to the synesthetic reader: if you have grapheme-color and you don't associate “s” with green, my apologies (and even if you do, it's probably not the same green _I'm_ thinking of). Note to the non-synesthetic reader: synesthetic associations are idiosyncratic, so even if two synesthetes associate “s” with green, it's probably not the same shade. These idiosyncratic associations often lead to passive-aggressive arguments.


One camp claims that grapheme-color isn't actually synesthesia, but instead _ideasthesia_. The Wikipedia quote above describes a very broad set of experiences, but generally synesthesia is understood to imply activation of one sense triggers activation of another, whereas ideasthesia means activation of a cognitive pathway related to _semantic reasoning_ triggers activation of a sense. I think the concept of ideasthesia has a lot of merit, but I still refer to any ideasthetic experience as “synesthesia” because most people are still overwhelmed by trying to imagine what _that_ is like.


I have a bunch of different kinds of synesthesia. Many of these involve color, and while it would be easiest for you to understand my synesthesia by viewing a visual representation of my experiences, so far I've been too lazy to make any. In the future, I hope to write posts that include artwork that explains the phenomenon better than I do. For the time being you'll have to make due with bullet points. Note: unless otherwise stated, when I say “I see”, I'm referring to my mind's eye. It's a long list, so here goes:

- _Grapheme-color_. One interesting thing I've noticed is that though I have different associations for each letter (and number), when those letters and numbers compose to form words or other numbers, I don't associate the letters with colors in isolation anymore. Words and letters tend to have a single color or gradient dominated by the first or first few symbols. Though most of the time this is associative, I've found I occasionally project colors onto my surroundings.
- _Sound-color_. Probably my favorite kind of synesthesia. Whenever I hear any kind of sound, I'll “see” a mix of colors, patterns and motion in 3D space in my mind's eye. This is especially nice when I listen to music because it's like having a personal music visualizer. I have taste in music just like everyone else, but when it comes to color vibrancy and excitement, electronic music takes the cake. I find it easier to isolate the different parts of an electronic song than a rock song, which leads to a different association for each element, and overall a more inspiring experience.
- _Ticker Tape_. I find this kind of synesthesia weird but fascinating. When I listen to anyone talk (including my internal monologue), I see a line of subtitles of what they're saying in my mind's eye. I can read the subtitles left-to-right, but they move across my mind's eye right-to-left, which is odd and not great UX in my opinion. Additionally, the words I see are colored according to my grapheme-color synesthesia. I plan to write more about ticker tape because I'm curious whether I can identify which fonts presumably influenced my association, and if there are any patterns in tone, speed, accent, etc. that influence the typography.
- _Temperature-color_. When I feel different temperatures, I see different colors. I believe these associations were heavily influenced by media I saw as a child (the typical hot = red, cold = blue), but I still think it's synesthesia since I immediately think of the color upon experiencing the temperature, and it seems the associations have texture and variation. Room temperature looks like a shade beige-white, and my mind frequently relegates it to background noise since it's always there.
- _Touch-color_. I think it may be more precise to say I have a color association for different stimuli to my nerve endings, as I see colors for _sensations_ including, but not limited to, touch. When I sit on a couch I see a vaguely buff-colored outline of my lazy shape where it presses into the furniture. When my muscles tighten, I see the tightness as a 3D object. I frequently go to the doctor for running injuries, and it's nice being able to point out in a model or muscle diagram what exactly hurts. When I walk down the street, I see a dotted outline of where my skin touches the air, formed by my moving hair follicles. I was once hospitalized for food poisoning. When I took a water IV, I saw the rush of cool water into my bloodstream as a light blue, 3D visualization of the vein structure of my forearm, which to this day is the coolest experience I've had with touch-color.
- _Taste-color_. Different tastes trigger different color associations. However, I don't know of a way to isolate taste from the feeling of food in my mouth, so it's possible that I just feel food differently with my mouth than my skin. The associations are different though. For example, pickles feel like a brush of paint on a palette, but taste sparkly. This is a fact and I do not accept discussion on the matter.
- _Smell-color_. One of my favorite colors is how diesel smells. I don't know why. It's sort of a smoky, amorphous green-black.
- _Sound-motion_. When I listen to music I move. This is different from tapping a foot to a beat; I need to move different parts of my body to each discernible part of a song, and if I hold back my face gets kind of twitchy (unpleasant, I know). I've found it best to move my hands and fingers since they have the highest concentration of easily-moved articulated joints in the smallest space, though my eyelids will suffice if I'm feeling lazy (concerning, I know).
- _Emotion-color and color-emotion_. When I feel, or see other people feeling an emotion, I see a color. When I see a color, I feel an emotion. These positive feedback loops can occasionally get out of hand so I try not to indulge (with varying degrees of success, as this is all involuntary). However, I do have a number of songs with happy colors in case I ever need a pick-me-up.
- _Ordinal Linguistic Personification_. This one is super weird and I'm in the middle of a more detailed write up, so I'll just link to the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_linguistic_personification) for now.
- _Spatial-sequence_. I perceive measurements of time as 3D objects occupying distinct spaces around my body. Spatial-sequence is a bit hard to describe because it mixes perception in the mind's eye with physical position in real space. For example, I think of a calendar year as a slightly warped, looped ribbon. The ribbon is comprised of twelve parts representing the months, each with a color and separated from its neighbors by a black outline. I conceptualize the loop as occupying a space above my right shoulder. It takes significantly more imagery to describe my perception of a week or time in general, so that may occupy a later post. Interestingly, most of the architects I've spoken to share this form of synesthesia.
- _Number-form_. When I see or think of a string of numbers—in particular numbers following a regular pattern—I visualize them in a specific way. For example, when I think of even numbers, my representation is a very slightly graded triangle. The triangle is composed of an in-order line of even numbers that start with 2 and increase in font size until around _1,137,232_ when the triangle peaks, and then the numbers begin decreasing in font size until they trail off into infinity.

You're entitled to take a breath. Continuing on: In the fall of 2012 I read an article about synesthesia which made me realize two things: 1) There's a label for what I have (it's a nice gradient of green and white and really rolls off the tongue), and; 2) Everybody else doesn't have it. How bizarre.


I've done a lot of introspection since finding out what synesthesia is, and I've discovered that my perception of the world is relatively quirky. One thing I can't wrap my head around, however, is how _you_ perceive the world. I have no idea what it's like to not see color in my mind's eye all the time, and consider the prospect quite baffling. Since the associations are involuntary, I can't just _not_ experience them, and I don't believe I ever have. So, I just assume that life without synesthesia is quite dull. You can try to convince me otherwise, but I have your senses too, you know.


Replacing sassiness with openness and a side of narcissism, I want to share my experience with everyone because I think it's for the most part awesome. With virtual- and mixed-reality technologies and creative tools on the rise, it's easier than ever to hand out samples of my mind's eye. I consider sharing this a lifelong project.


Last but not least, if you have synesthesia or think you might, please [reach out](mailto:dbmcisaac1@gmail.com); I love to talk about it.
