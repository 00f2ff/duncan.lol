console.log inserts environmental consciousness and puns into logging for web development. It's inspired by an excellent, Leptodactylidaeic approach to logging pioneered by [Tim Holman](http://tholman.com/console-dot-frog/).


With console.log, you can now log messages to a browser console that look more like logs than they did before:
