## _Qualified Immunity_  
LINEBREAK_MARKER  
Qualified immunity  
Quantified impunity  
The courts need to make room for peace  
For we the People will not be mollified  
By police and officials underqualified  
LINEBREAK_MARKER


## _I'm Feeling America_  
LINEBREAK_MARKER  
How do you feel?  
I feel the pain of millions  
This is what America feels like  
And it makes me want to throw up  
But that's counterproductive  
I need to show up  
LINEBREAK_MARKER  
America is a collage  
But when the cops look at it  
All they see is printer paper  
They only look for marks  
Arrest as white-out  
LINEBREAK_MARKER  
It's like a war zone  
Inspired by the “strongmen”  
Acted out by the weak men  
Hiding in their bunkers  
Afraid of diversity  
Afraid to face the angry faces of adversity  
LINEBREAK_MARKER  
Police tatter the Constitution with rubber bullets  
Trample on your right to protest with horses  
Fight the peace with bombs and gas  
They want to make you cry  
LINEBREAK_MARKER  
Peaceful protesters attacked like insurgents  
America's military is bored  
We're waging a forever war on terror  
When we run out of terrorists we just make some more  
We have a democratic republic  
Slipping into a fascist republic  
The preservation of democracy is abhorred  
LINEBREAK_MARKER  
It's quite explicit  
That if you are complicit  
You're trying to make America nevermore  
LINEBREAK_MARKER

## _America Is A Child_  
LINEBREAK_MARKER  
America is a child  
It can learn  
We can teach it to yearn  
For a new take on its fathers' words:  
“We the People”  
“All **People** created equal”  
Let's make a sequel  
That ain't the prequel
