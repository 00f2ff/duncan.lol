## **Leave it better than you found it**


Continuously improve the product, the codebase, the processes, the culture. Work such that others appreciate that you were there. “Not my job” is like not picking up litter. While fixing a particular thing may not be my job, finding a fix and fixer is.


## **Treat coworkers like customers**


Everyone deserves a good user experience. My output results in two products: one for the customer, and one for the coworker. The customer product is the “Product”. The coworker product is engineer-friendly APIs and code, audience-specific documentation, patience, mentorship and support.
