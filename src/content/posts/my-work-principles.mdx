## **Leave it better than you found it**


Continuously improve the product, the codebase, the processes, the culture. Work such that others appreciate that you were there. “Not my job” is like not picking up litter. While fixing a particular thing may not be my job, finding a fix and fixer is.


## **Treat coworkers like customers**


Everyone deserves a good user experience. My output results in two products: one for the customer, and one for the coworker. The customer product is the “Product”. The coworker product is engineer-friendly APIs and code, audience-specific documentation, patience, mentorship and support.


## Right and wrong is a function of time


The right solution for today may not be the right solution next week, next quarter, or next year; the inverse can be true for any permutation of time period comparison. If a solution is predicted to be right for the future but an organization fails to define clear measures of success, suggesting that the solution is right may be a contraindication. 


## Strong opinions, loosely held


The more knowledgeable I feel about product development and software engineering, the stronger my opinions tend to be. I enjoy a good debate, but I love it when people change my mind. My bar is high, but it's not asymptotic.
