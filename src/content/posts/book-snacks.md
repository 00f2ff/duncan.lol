When I read a book and come across a line or section I find illuminating or thought-provoking, I make a dog ear on the bottom of the page. I could use highlighter (but I'd forget where) or tape (which seems too formal), but I've found the dog ear keeps me in the flow of reading. The dog ear is little, not like one I'd use to mark a return point. The dog ear is subversive, it is allowed to exist even in a hard cover book. Whereas reading or rereading a whole book is like sitting down to a multi course meal, sometimes I just want to snack. My bookshelves are like a pantry; I can check the bottom corners for small dog ears to zero in on a page, then I reread the page, and I get my snack.

## The pantry

I went through all the books I could find in my apartment in San Francisco and sought out the snacks. The following list is chronically incomplete, which is another way of saying my current pantry is much smaller than that at the house I grew up in and all of the other places I spent reading a lot of books (not libraries though — I only do this to my own books).

> The demands of the modern world make it such that we are forced to steal the time we need to think and process. Making the conscious move to hit a trail checks all of the boxes: solitude, quiet, attention. In other words, I advise Normal People to focus their efforts not on finding passion but rather on creating an environment that will facilitate the arrival of inspiration. Trails are the perfect environment for this.

> Dots are information. The more information you collect, the more frequently you can make meaningful connections that can make other people feel good and give you an edge in business. Using whatever information I've collected to gather guests together in a spirit of shared experience is what I call connecting the dots. If I don't turn over the rocks, I won't see the dots. If I don't collect the dots, I can't connect the dots. If I don't know that someone works, say, for a magazine whose managing editor I happen to know, I've lost a chance to make a meaningful connection that could enhance our relationship with the guest and the guest's relationship with us. The information is there. You just have to choose to look.

> People duck as a natural reflex when something is hurled at them. Similarly, the excellence reflex is a natural reaction to fix something that isn't right, or to improve something that could be better. The excellence reflex is rooted in instinct and upbringing, and then constantly honed through awareness, caring, and practice. The overarching concern to do the right thing well is something we can't train for. Either it's there or it isn't. So we need to train how to _hire_ for it.

> Other nights, Ayrs likes me to read him poetry, especially his beloved Keats. He whispers the verses as I recite, as if his voice is leaning on mine.

> The flat world is curved in the boy's eye.

> The evening was a lemon blue.

> I had to squeeze into a three-inch slot. I lost my balance when the train pulled away, but a human crumple zone buffered by fall. We stayed like that, half fallen. The Diagonal People.

> So down I went to the ocean an' watched Lady Moon to cool my fiery mis'ry. A greenbill came draggin' itself up the beach to lay eggs I mem'ry, an' I nearly spikered the turtle there'n'then out o' spite, see, if my life weren't fair why should an animal's be? But I seen its eyes, so ancient was its eyes they seen the future, yay, an' I let the turtle go.

> Souls cross ages like clouds cross skies, an' tho' a cloud's shape nor hue nor size don't stay the same, it's still a cloud an' so is a soul. Who can say where the cloud's blowed from or who the soul'll be ‘morrow? Only Sonmi the east an' the west an' the compass an' the atlas, yay, only the atlas o' clouds.

> Sunlite bent around the world, lending fragile color to wildflowers.

> My “friends” at Aurora House were senile boors who cheated at Scrabble with stunning ineptitude and who were nice to me solely because in the Kingdom of the Dying the most Enfeebled is the common Maginot Line against the Unconquerable Führer.

> Poor England. Too much history for its acreage. Years grow inwards here, like my toenails.

> Water vapor rises from the Swannekke cooling towers like malign genies.

> _What_ is _wrong?_ Luisa's birthmark throbs. She grasps for the ends of this elastic moment, but they disappear into the past and the future. “Nothing.”

> Divide your views into “soft opinions” and “hard opinions”:  
> _Soft opinions:_ you have a perspective to offer and ideas for someone else to consider  
> _Hard opinions:_ you have a clear and potentially empathic point of view

> By doing this, you can create space for others to comfortably disagree with your “soft opinions” and establish their own views. Reserve “hard opinions” for when they really matter.

> In our experience about 10% of synesthetes experience eidetic images, or what is popularly called “photographic memory.” The co-occurence of synesthesia and eideticism was first noted by the German psychologist Jaensch in 1930. Others have studied the relationship more recently. An eidetic image recreates previously seen objects or events with great clarity, either immediately after they have been viewed or after a considerable period of time. Like some synesthetic percepts, eidetic images are spatially extended in that eidetikers behave as if they are scanning an externally projected image. Often they will look at some plain surface that serves as a convenient background.

> In other cases, the color has a definite location either internally or externally, and here the experience is called a photism. (Some individuals with sound → color or taste → color synesthesia report localized photisms that obscure real, physical space the way hallucinations do, or else they say things look tinted by a transparent “overlay,” as if looking through a piece of colored cellophane. Here, however, we are talking only about colored graphemes and have yet to encounter grapheme → color synesthetes who perceive colors opaquely.)  
> …Problematically, the term “projector” conjures up images of a movie projector and suggests a hallucination, while “associator” sounds to some ears like a memorized association, which synesthesia is not. In place of these terms, we suggest “localizer” and “nonlocalizer.”  
> …Note that both types can tell the difference between synesthetic colors and real colors (that is, they do not make the mistake of insisting that a black 3 is actually colored). And they can tell the difference between synesthetic colors and objects in the real world. In other words, synesthetic experience—even for localizers—is neither film projection nor hallucination.

> Laurel experiences a rare audiomotor synesthesia in which sound triggers a sensation of movement, or of striking a particular posture. For example, hearing a particular harmony in the bass line makes her body feel as though it is moving in ways described in table 4.4. We thus see that while sounds most often induce color, the variety of synesthetic experiences in response to it is as wide as those observed in other forms of synesthesia.

> The idea is that synesthetes have more abundant connections among conceptual maps and accordingly are more facile at linking superficially unrelated concepts and seeing deep similarities in them. Objectively, synesthetes are in fact facile at fathoming deep similarities in seemingly unrelated realms. Likewise, they have a higher aptitude than nonsynesthetes for figurative speech, though this is likely an effect rather than a cause.

> Synesthetes generally love having their peculiar perceptions, even when at times they are unpleasant or lead to embarrassing situations. We have shown how synesthesia enhances life, not just by the pleasant affect it affords but also by usefully improving memory.  
> On the flip side, however, there are times when synesthesia can be burdensome or confusing—when, for example, percepts pile up to an overwhelming sensory overload or in the rare cases when bidirectional synesthesia leads to a perceptual feedback loop.
