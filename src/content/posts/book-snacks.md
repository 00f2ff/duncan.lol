When I read a book and come across a line or section I find illuminating or thought-provoking, I make a dog ear on the bottom of the page. I could use highlighter (but I'd forget where) or tape (which seems too formal), but I've found the dog ear keeps me in the flow of reading. The dog ear is little, not like one I'd use to mark a return point. The dog ear is subversive, it is allowed to exist even in a hard cover book. Whereas reading or rereading a whole book is like sitting down to a multi course meal, sometimes I just want to snack. My bookshelves are like a pantry; I can check the bottom corners for small dog ears to zero in on a page, then I reread the page, and I get my snack.

## The pantry

I went through all the books I could find in my apartment in San Francisco and sought out the snacks. The following list is chronically incomplete, which is another way of saying my current pantry is much smaller than that at the house I grew up in and all of the other places I spent reading a lot of books (not libraries though â€” I only do this to my own books).

> The demands of the modern world make it such that we are forced to steal the time we need to think and process. Making the conscious move to hit a trail checks all of the boxes: solitude, quiet, attention. In other words, I advise Normal People to focus their efforts not on finding passion but rather on creating an environment that will facilitate the arrival of inspiration. Trails are the perfect environment for this.

> Two days later, at a state dinner in the White House, Mark gets another chance to speak with Xi. In Mandarin, he asked Xi if he'll do him the honor of naming his unborn child. Xi refuses.

> Dots are information. The more information you collect, the more frequently you can make meaningful connections that can make other people feel good and give you an edge in business. Using whatever information I've collected to gather guests together in a spirit of shared experience is what I call connecting the dots. If I don't turn over the rocks, I won't see the dots. If I don't collect the dots, I can't connect the dots. If I don't know that someone works, say, for a magazine whose managing editor I happen to know, I've lost a chance to make a meaningful connection that could enhance our relationship with the guest and the guest's relationship with us. The information is there. You just have to choose to look.

> People duck as a natural reflex when something is hurled at them. Similarly, the excellence reflex is a natural reaction to fix something that isn't right, or to improve something that could be better. The excellence reflex is rooted in instinct and upbringing, and then constantly honed through awareness, caring, and practice. The overarching concern to do the right thing well is something we can't train for. Either it's there or it isn't. So we need to train how to _hire_ for it.

> Other nights, Ayrs likes me to read him poetry, especially his beloved Keats. He whispers the verses as I recite, as if his voice is leaning on mine.
