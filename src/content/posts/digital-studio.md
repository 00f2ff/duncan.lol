Occasionally I reflect on what my blog is. I know [why I write](/posts/to-those-who-wish-they-wrote-more), but I'm less clear on what an appropriate amount of substance and structure should be for what I publish on the Internet. Most of my thoughts are brief and silly, and I keep them offline, where offline means bothering my wife. Twitter is (was?) a good place to post brief thoughts online, but I don't use Twitter much and derive a small amount of pleasure from how dumb the [three tweets](https://twitter.com/hi_im_duncan) I've made over 10 years are, so I might keep it embalmed.

A couple of years ago I came across the idea of treating one's work as a _Digital Garden._ I'm fond of the way gardener extraordinaire Maggie Appleton described it in her evergreen essay, [_Garden History_](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)_._

> A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory â€“ notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing.

## Semantics

Maggie categorizes her works from less to more refined as ðŸŒ± _Seedlings,_ followed by ðŸŒ¿ _Budding,_ and finally, ðŸŒ³ _Evergreen._ Though I like the idea of treating an idea opus as a garden, I've never really considered my ideas to be living things. Rather, I think of them as objects composed of star stuff and information. My objects start as rough ideas or outlines. Dedicating a bit more time to them sands down some of the rough edges and creates a better form factor. Intensive editing and review lends polish. And since I love it when I realize my mind has changed, I leave open the opportunity to reform an object that may have been on a shelf collecting dust.

I'm starting to include these inanimate metaphors on my blog entries. My hope is that normalizing the publication of rough works will lead me to produce earlier and more often.
