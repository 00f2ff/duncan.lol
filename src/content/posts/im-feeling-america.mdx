## _Qualified Immunity_


  
Qualified immunity  
Quantified impunity  
The courts need to make room for peace  
For we the People will not be mollified  
By police and officials under qualified


## _I'm Feeling America_


  
How do you feel?  
I feel the pain of millions  
This is what America feels like  
And it makes me want to throw up  
But that's counterproductive  
I need to show up


  
America is a collage  
But when the cops look at it  
All they see is printer paper  
They only look for marks  
Arrest as white-out


  
It's like a war zone  
Inspired by the “strongmen”  
Acted out by the weak men  
Hiding in their bunkers  
Afraid of diversity  
Afraid to face the angry faces of adversity


  
Police tatter the Constitution with rubber bullets  
Trample on your right to protest with horses  
Fight the peace with bombs and gas  
They want to make you cry


  
Peaceful protesters attacked like insurgents  
America's military is bored  
We're waging a forever war on terror  
When we run out of terrorists we just make some more  
We have a democratic republic  
Slipping into a fascist republic  
The preservation of democracy is abhorred


  
It's quite explicit  
That if you are complicit  
You're trying to make America nevermore


## _America Is A Child_


  
America is a child  
It can learn  
We can teach it to yearn  
For a new take on its fathers' words:  
“We the People”  
“All **People** created equal”  
Let's make a sequel  
That ain't the prequel
