# Ideas

- [] Deploy to Vercel, route duncanmcisaac.com and duncan.lol to blog
- [] Pick a more privacy-centric analytics tool than Google (I remember seeing some options on HN)

## Notion thoughts

- I think I'll load content from Notion in and put custom styling on it
- Image hosting, interactive code, etc will start as uploads to Notion / Codepen embeds in Notion and I'll expand from there

## Issues

This app doesn't load on my Chrome browser profile. It's fine on joint and work, but for some reason
on the personal email one Chrome has permanently cached the Curious Cardinals dashboard redirect.
