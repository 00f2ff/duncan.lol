# Ideas

- [] Deploy to Vercel, route duncanmcisaac.com and duncan.lol to blog
- [] Pick a more privacy-centric analytics tool than Google (I remember seeing some options on HN)
- [] Deploy using git merge (captures code changes and new md files)

## Notion thoughts

- I decided using the unofficial lib is too much of a hassle so I'm just exporting as md and styling

## Tech notes

- Move to SSG to reduce latency. I can just redeploy the site with a new build via git each time I publish a new post
