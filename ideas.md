## Tech notes

- notion-to-md package supports custom transformers: https://github.com/souvikinator/notion-to-md#custom-transformers
  - Try not to use in order to simplify the content pipeline
- things to keep in mind with next-mdx-remote: https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote#caveats

Do I need this or does it work differently with the hashicorp lib? https://mdxjs.com/docs/extending-mdx/#using-plugins
Maybe for code?

## Bugs

- Using Chakra may be complex because I'm not sure if the MDX is recognized
